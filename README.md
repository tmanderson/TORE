# TORE: A non-trivial JavaScript Application

TORE is a non-trivial JavaScript application as a more-complex-but-not-too-complex
companion to [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com). The goal was to make a single page
application that serves a real purpose. Ideally, this would form into a nice,
usable RSS reader.

The project can be viewed [here](http://tmanderson.github.io/TORE).

### Install
Within any of the root directories (e.g. angular, backbone), run a `$> bower install`
and fire up a server (e.g. `$> php -S localhost:8080`, `$> python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
and have at it!

### Third-Party API
TORE uses [Google Feeds API](https://developers.google.com/feed/).
