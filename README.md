# TORE: Feed Reader (Backbone)
## A non-trivial JavaScript application (for example)

The project can be viewed [here](http://tmanderson.github.io/TORE).

### Install
Within any of the root directories (e.g. angular, backbone), startup a server
(e.g. `$> php -S localhost:8080`, `$> python -m SimpleHTTPServer`), and have
at it!

TORE is a non-trivial JavaScript application as a more-complex-but-not-too-complex
companion to [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com). The goal was to make a single page
application that serves a real purpose. Ideally, this would form into a nice,
usable RSS reader.

### Third-Party API
TORE uses [Google Feeds API](https://developers.google.com/feed/).
